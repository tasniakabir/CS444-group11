\f0\fs24 \cf2 The objective of this homework assignment is to first understand the SLOB first-fit algorithm and how it works. From there, we can use this information to then learn how to implement the best-fit allocation algorithm and compute the efficiency of both the first-fit and best-fit algorithms. In order to do so, the first step that we plan to take is to identify the first-first algorithm in the slob.c file and use it as a base template. We can then use it to scan the memory and allocate data to the first free and fitting space found. The best-fit algorithm, however, will seek further and try to find the closest match, so we will definitely have to adjust and make changes to the implementation. These changes can be easy made and recorded within a patch file. Using that patch file, we will also be able to see the major similarities and differences between the two. Lastly, we will use the syscall() function to test our program and compare the free and used space in memory.\
